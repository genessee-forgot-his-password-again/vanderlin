One more task... then I shalt make myself scarce...
Who doth he reckon himself to be..? I ought to show him a thing or two...
I prithee the next wretch shan't plead... I loathe it when they plead...
Mayhaps... mayhaps 'tis time I lay down this trade... become a soilson...
I pray that the weather be fair...
Spake unto him that we ought to have buried her, and yet... well, a dullard, that one...
Mayhap the next task doth bring good coin...
Blast those lords... I pray for a chance to knife one, right in his gut...
